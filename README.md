# Projective Geometric Algebra

Based on the convention and work of https://bivector.net/index.html

This library attempts to define useful functionality of 2d Project Geometric Algebra (PGA) in a type safe way, meaning all basis vector (e1, e2 etc) cannot accidentally be mixed up. It also will define useful types like Point and Line, aiming for specificity rather than generality.

It is also made to teach myself the fundamentals of PGA.
